# Predicting-Miami-Housing-Prices
analyzed a dataset of 13,932 single-family homes in Miami using R, applying feature engineering to improve model accuracy. I implemented and compared multiple regression techniques, including linear, ridge, and lasso regression. Ridge and lasso models achieved an RMSE of 0.27 and an R-squared value of 0.79, providing reliable predictions for housing prices.

In addition to traditional regression methods, I applied advanced statistical techniques to explore the relationship between housing prices and factors such as proximity to noise sources, water bodies, and urban centers. These insights helped inform pricing decisions with high accuracy, demonstrating the value of statistical analysis in real estate pricing models.
